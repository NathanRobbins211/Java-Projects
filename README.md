# About Java Projects
A collection of Java code snippets that demonstrate a myriad of different applications.
Each file should have a header (inside the file) documenting what the program does.

# Instructions
 - Download the file you want to test
 - Open Command Prompt
 - (Making sure the file is in the target directory) type in `javac FileName.java` to compile that file
 - You should have a new .class file, with the same name, created from the compile
 - Type in `java FileName` to run that .class file
